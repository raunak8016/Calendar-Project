# Calendar-Project
For the Iteration 2 Project, we coverted our console based virtual calendar application into a GUI using JavaFX. A user interacting with our application can pick a year and a month of their choice and view a visualization of this month in a new window. From there, the user can pick any they have selected and add an event to their schedule. From there, the user can view there entire schedule by clicking the schedule view button in the application.
