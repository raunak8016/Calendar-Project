# Calendar-Project
Our CPSC 233 Project
For our CPSC 2333 Iteration 1 Project, we built a virtual calendar.  A user interacting with our program will have the ability to 
pick a year and a month of their choice and view a visualization of this month in the console.  From there, the user can pick a 
day in the month they have selected and add an event to this day.  In doing so, the user will create an object of type schedule for this day 
which will hold all the events they wish to store for the day.  From there, the user will have the oppurtunity to see a visualization of there 
complete schedule in the console!
